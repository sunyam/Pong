This is the multi-player classic Pong game. One player moves using arrow keys; and the other using 'W' 'S'. Your job is to stop the ball from going in your gutter and try to put it in the other player's; ball keeps accelerating with every collision with pads. So, difficulty in controlling the ball increases!
